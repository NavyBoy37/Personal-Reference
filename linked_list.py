"""A normal list in python is an array that uses indexed storage.
 This means it can call upon individual elements of that array without
 cycling through all of them."""

"""A linked list cannot call upon individual components of its storage.
Rather it cycles through the list in a direction based off address nodes which
are placed with the actual information.  It cycles through until it gets what 
it needs.  It is like a FOR loop with the array list.  It checks each obj in the
list until it finds what it needs."""
